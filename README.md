This README file was generated using this application. You can view a video demonstration of its creation [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKJ-LNOMIEcESW46avyd4fXJw4E0bNFH/view?usp=share_link) <br>If you know how you would like your formatting (where you want screenshots, page breaks, git commands, etc.) you can add them within the prompts as shown in the video. If you are not yet certain of the formatting you would like, you can use this application to generate all the main information and functionality you need for a high-quality README file with built-in features such as a functioning table of contents. <br> <br> To run the program, use the following command in the terminal:<br> `$ node index.js`<br> <br> <img src="./assets/images/Screenshot1.png" style="border: 1px solid blue;" width=100% /> <br> <br>  You will be prompted with several questions regarding your project. After completing all prompts, the program will create a README file and console log "Successfully created README.md!" if successful. If unsuccessful, the program will console log the error.  <br> <br> <img src="./assets/images/Screenshot2.png" style="border: 1px solid blue;" width=100% />
